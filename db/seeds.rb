    So I sent a request. The teacher ( obviously) denied it. And I acted like a fucking idiot and sent the request 5 more times , wondering why I was getting denied every time. My friends texted me saying that I sent a request with the wrong ID. And now apparently, I'm the ostrich dude.

    In any case, we were at some street festival and my cousins and their parents were visiting from out of town so we were out all evening exploring the festival. I somehow ended up holding a bunch of everyone‚Äôs paper cones that the cotton candy came on, so I found a bin to put them into and headed back to find my family. There was a massive crowd at this point because there was a guy bungee jumping off a crane, but in the crowd, I spotted my cousin‚Äôs jacket. I had this habit of grabbing his manboobs because it annoyed him so much and to my brother, other cousin (his brother) and myself, of course, his outbursts were absolutely hilarious, so I walked up behind him and squeezed them - and I squeezed them really hard.
    
    What followed was this hoarse gurgly scream followed by multiple blows to my head and neck. I had absolutely no idea what had happened at this point, so I just kept saying sorry to him whilst blocking my face, and when I stepped back a bit I realized that this was actually not my cousin but an older woman in her 80‚Äôs who had the exact same jacket on.
    
    I screamed I was sorry and fucking BOLTED. There was police there already just sort of patrolling so they walk up to the commotion. I had found my family and frantically told them that we had to leave, to which my dad loudly and annoyedly says ‚ÄúCome on man! why don‚Äôt you just take a shit in a public toilet for once in your life?‚Äù (Yes, I was one of those kids) because he thought I needed to do that, but no, the police came to me, they had a chat with my parents, I explained, apologized to the woman profusely, who was still understandably and rightfully very very upset. The cops sort of understood the situation especially when they saw my cousin‚Äôs identical jacket but still gave me the whole ‚Äúthis is why you don‚Äôt mess around‚Äù spiel and my cousins laughed at me for ages. #lovemylife #screw #einstein #nomore", category: other_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

post = Post.create(user: fun_person, content: "I committed the sin of falling in love with two people. Not at the same time. One was my first love who I was with from being 14, together for 3 years then he broke up with me and broke my heart. The other was during that time of heartbreak I fell for a friend but didn't realise it because I was committed to being single at the time. But then my childhood sweetheart came back into my life and we got back together. However I've always had this lingering love and attraction to the friend.

    Anyway long story short. Many years gone by and a few issues and doubts in my relationship with my first love kept emerging. I tried to keep the friend as a friend telling myself it was ok to chat on messenger as long as we kept it neutral even though I kept having dreams about him and secretly agonizing over whether I'd made the right decisions.
    
    After many years of this, It all got too much as the mixed feelings and the turmoil never ended. I made the mistake of meeting up with the second love and things escalated. I almost cheated. So I decided to break up with my childhood sweetheart and go out with the other love. It was really good at first but then it didn't work out for me because I felt too guilty and love sick over leaving the first love. And I sacrificed everything to take the chance on it. Now I've ruined it with both and have to live with the consequences of my actions. I feel totally heart broken. I didn't want to live without either of them in my life now I have neither. This has all been over the last 17 years if my life.

    I had an unexpected free night last night - no kid, no boyfriend, no friends available. Everyone was busy so I decided to get myself a little treat for dinner and just relax and watch tv.
    
    Before I had my dinner, I had a bag of Flaming Hot Cheeto Puffs beforehand. I eat tons of spicy food and never have an issue. I ate these probably about 6:00PM and had plenty of beverage throughout the night.
    
    I went to sleep around 11, and by 1AM, I had the most intense case of heartburn I have ever had. I was literally choking and gasping for air, searching frantically for my inhaler so I could try to breathe, but then the choking started to make me vomit. The choking and the vomiting made me start to piss myself. I was sleeping naked so I was pissing down my naked self. It was really frightening being woken up like that.
    
    Not only was I in pain from the actual heartburn but now I was puking up the Flaming Hots and it burns and is making me cry. Once I could somewhat catch by breath, I started chewing antacids I found in my cabinet that apparently expired in 2018 and was able to mostly get composed. I cleaned myself up and went to the kitchen and made a glass of chocolate almond milk and started to feel way better but still burning inside. I was able to go back to sleep after a while. #almostdied #screw", category: health_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

We are on vacation in a rented house. Some relatives dropped in to visit us.

My wife wanted to offer them tea. So she handed me a kettle and asked me to boil some water.

I filled it in the kitchen sink. Then I put the kettle on one of the burners on the range and turned the flame on under it.

A minute or two later, an acrid burning smell started to fill the kitchen. My wife realized what was happening, darted to the range, and turned off the burner. But she was too late to save ...

... the electric kettle. That‚Äôs right ‚Äî it was the kind that has an internal heating mechanism and sits on a plugged-in base.

The outside of the kettle was scorched, and the electronics inside it were definitely fried.

As a result, I‚Äôve just returned from Bed Bath and Beyond, $50 poorer but hopefully a little wiser.

(I don‚Äôt drink hot beverages, so I didn‚Äôt know there was such a thing as an electric kettle for boiling water. But I sure know now.)

This actually happened today. I (31 male) and my coworkers have been going into work more and more lately as vaccines get rolled out. Today I was sitting in my office working when I spilled some water on my pants right in the area that would make people think I pissed my pants. I didn‚Äôt notice when it happened. I decided to walk around campus to get a snack from the cafeteria and when I was walking down the stairs, a coworker laughed when we crossed paths. It was then I noticed that my pants had the water spot.

No big deal, I sometimes have spare pants in my car so I went there to change pants. I get to the car but no extra pants. I‚Äôm looking for napkins with no luck when I see that there are a couple of my wife‚Äôs feminine pads. Lightbulbs go off as I think ‚ÄúI know how these work. These will soak up this water from my pants no problem‚Äù so i open one ip and stick it on the water spot. Of course nothing happens so I think ‚Äúhmmm the problem here is placement!‚Äù So I move the pad to under my pants between pants and underwear. It was perfect. Double front attack. Soak up the water from the pants and the underwear at the same time. So I place it and start walking to the cafeteria. The thought that this wouldn‚Äôt work never crossed my mind.

I‚Äôm waiting in line, socially distanced. At this point, unbeknownst to me, the pad has slid down my pants to the bottom near my shoe. When I move up to the next spot in line, I get a tap on my shoulder from the lady behind me. She says ‚ÄúI think you dropped something‚Äù and pointed to the ground. There on the ground, right next to my shoe, was a completely dry feminine pad.

I said ‚Äúoh thanks!‚Äù Picked it up, threw it away and walked back to my office. #screw #firsttimes #lifelessons #reputation", category: leisure_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

    Daddy, you need to stop rinsing your mouth out after brushing your teeth
    
    Me: Wait, what?
    
    Apparently, rinsing your mouth after brushing gets rid of all the fluoride from the toothpaste which is designed to protect your teeth.
    
    I've always had sensitive teeth, but always put it down to just 'one of those things'. It's not something that anyone has ever said to me and we used to have our own 'rinsing cups' when we were growing up.

    My uncle had a habit of losing things and gave us a candy as a reward if we found it for him. So, all of us cousins would try and find an opportunity to find his lost stuff for him lol
    
    When I (16F) was like 5, we were at his place when I saw him accidentally drop his car keys near the sofa. I decided to wait for him to realise his keys were missing. But then I thought that if someone else find them before me, they'll get the candy. So being the little smartass I was, I kicked the keys under the sofa
    
    My cousin saw me doing that and took them out. Oh hell no, I snatched them from his hand and ran. The closest thing to me was a flower pot with some pebbles and artificial roses in it. I tossed them in there and covered them with pebbles. I distracted him by asking him to play hide and seek. I was planning to give the keys to my uncle before leaving. Guess who else got distracted and forgot about them...... me
    
    After a while, my mom asked me come as they were leaving. So, we got home. Turns out.... my uncle ripped the whole house apart after we had left. He must have promised his kids loads of candies lmao but they couldn't find it. Idk what happened next but I never got questioned about them. He probably got a new copy or something
    
    Many, many years later, he sold his house and moved out of the country with his family. Well, a few days ago, we couldn't find the t.v remote and my mother was looking for it in the flower pot. I thought it was ridiculous and asked her why she was doing that. She started laughing and told me about how my uncle lost his keys and when he was moving out, he found his car keys in the flower pot. Do you remember it? Of course you don't, you were so little. Well, I do. He called me and was freaking out so much
    
    I was like........ holy shit. I had totally forgotten about that. I'm so embarrassed now. I did THAT just for the sake of a candy which I never got. I don't know, should I apologise to him now or let it go? TIFU by hiding them and forgetting about them? I'm gonna tell my mom first
    
    Edit: lemme clear the confusions regarding the age and timeline. This happened back in 2010 when I was 5. My uncle left the country in 2017, I was 12 then. But I just found out about the keys drama a few days ago. 16 now aha! #screw #longscrew ", category: family_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

    I was sitting in french class when i had to poo. It was the last class and only 10 minutes left, so i thought i might as well just wait till i get home.
    
    I get out of class and talk to my friends for a bit, when i start not only feeling a huge need to poop but also dizzyness and nausea. It became pretty severe, but i decided to just hop on to the bus and wait till i get home anyway.
    
    I felt fucking horrible, and slowly noticed i was losing vision, as color became less and less saturated. I took a sip of water and casually continued sitting, and it was now that my entire face felt cold as fuck and i started intensely sweating in my hair specifically, as i was trying to hold in the poop. My vision then went to shit, it looked like a black and white film and i had a bunch of noise in my ears, so i immideately decided to open the empty compartment of my backpack in case i had to puke and chugged the rest of my water. I also have no idea why, but i relaxed my legs and arms.
    
    I slowly regained color again, and by now, while i sit here on the toilet writing this, dont have any issues with vision and feel fine.
    
    Perhaps i should see a doctor? #screw #butthurt #alive #lessonlearnt #lifelessons", category: leisure_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

    Pine scented. I liked it, it was fresh and slightly musky, and it didn‚Äôt have anything that would cause an allergic reaction. I‚Äôve used it before in my room and on my soccer and track bags and nothing went wrong, but then today I used it in the bathroom because hey, last night was taco night. This bathroom has no ventilation whatsoever and the AC is on so I couldn‚Äôt open the window, so the only thing to do was febreze. So I sprayed a little bit and called it good. This evening my mom sat me down to have a chat and I was freaking out a bit because it‚Äôs never good when she does that. Mom: So I used the bathroom earlier and I noticed something unusual. Me, confused: What was it? Mom: Be honest, how long have you been smoking pot? At this moment I‚Äôm totally confused. 
        Not only am I an athlete and a singer and can‚Äôt even stand the thought of smoking, but I‚Äôm also allergic to pot to the point where I have issues when I‚Äôm around it, so I had never even touched the stuff. 
        Me: I don‚Äôt. Never have. 
        Mom: I smelled it! The whole bathroom smells like pot. At this moment I finally realize that she must‚Äôve been smelling my febreze. I started laughing at the absurdity of the situation. Mom: Are you high right now? 
        Me: It‚Äôs my febreze. It‚Äôs pine scented. Mom: Yeah, right. I go get the can and show her, then she sprays a tiny bit to test. 
        Mom: Why the hell would you buy febreze that smells like pot? So now I am forbidden from using the febreze, but at least my mom doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm stoned. #screw #einstein #lovemylife ", category: family_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

    I live in an upscale modular home park where men are out numbered by women 2 to 1. Most of us are middle age or older and try to mind our own business. The women are more flirty than usual, but that's fine.
    
    A few years ago the senior lady across the street would make it a habit to watch me mow my lawn. Some days she's bring me cookies or a hamburger or something to drink.
    
    This morning I was enjoying my music when two older women, probably mid to late 60s walked by my place. They tried desperately to get my attention, but I wasn't in the mood to visit or be sociable. I'm known pretty well locally because I worked for our local paper and write restaurant reviews.
    
    On the second or third time I pushed my mower in the direction where they were in my line of sight, I could see them again trying to get my attention. I really wanted to ignore them and didn't want to seem mean, but I stopped the mower and pulled out my earbuds and said to them 'How are you ladies? I can't really stop to talk, I have a lot to do today.'
    
    The one who had seemed most animated spoke up. 'We're sorry to bother you, but we have grandchildren visiting us.
    
    Me: Bring them over, I'd like to meet them.
    
    Her: It's not that. We just want you to zip up your shorts. We can see your underwear. #screw #einstein #lovemylife", category: other_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

We were just chatting about and I made a joke which she didn't understand, so I explained the joke to her, to which she replies 'I'm such a tubelight' (tubelight meant slow minded in this context). So thinking it would be relevant, I decided to send the emoji what resembles most to a tubelight(üíà). However I didn't know that it was a barber pole emoji.

She got confused by the emoji and googled it. And the first link to that was the page to the urban dictionary.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=barber%2bpole&amp=true

The first definition of the page on that time was this montrosity.

'When a heterosexual couple are having sexual intercourse, with the woman, who is menstuating, is riding on top, and the man ejaculates. After a moment she dismounts and the combination of blood and semen mixed on the erect penis simulates a barber pole.'

She sent me a screenshot and asked me 'Uhh what?'. I fucked up. I panicked and scrambled as soon as I can to clarify that 'Oh god no, that's not what I meant, I thought it was a tubelight emoji'. I basically had to clarify that I was not a sick pervert was just an innocent mistake. She was still skeptical of me for a few days because of that. #screw #einstein #lovemylife", category: relationship_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

    My son was born right around the kickoff of the pandemic last year. Since no family could come visit, we did a lot of video calls.
    
    One day I was in the kitchen cooking breakfast al naturale because I hate clothes. My wife was in the living room with the baby who was around 3 or 4 months old. They were on a group video chat with my wife's mother and two of her sisters with the camera obviously facing away from the kitchen.
    
    Several minutes into the conversation I overhear my wife say 'oh you want to play with the phone?' Followed quickly by 'oh no oh no OH NO' and some uproarious laughter coming from the phone's speakers.
    
    That little shit had reached out to grab the phone and somehow hit the flip camera button, putting more of me on display than my in-laws ever needed to see. I hadn't pieced together what had happened so I didn't cover up or anything, and it took a good couple of seconds for my wife to get the camera to flip back, so everyone got a decent show.
    
    They still tease me about it, doing things like answering video calls with their eyes shut and asking 'is everyone decent? Can I open my eyes?'. #screw #einstein #lovemylife #icanexplain", category: family_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))

Aight, so my sweet sweet sweet boyfriend (28M) and I (26F) have been together for 5 years. We‚Äôve always talked about getting married so I wasn‚Äôt in a rush or trying to pressure him to propose cause it doesn‚Äôt make too much of a difference to me since I plan on being with him for the rest of my life and blah blah blah.

Anyways, to the fuck up.

So a family member of his is getting married and he was out drinking with them. He comes home, and we‚Äôre just joking around and I say something along the lines of ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt propose to me during our camping trip!‚Äù Which is in a week.

His face dropped.

My face dropped.

I suddenly pieced everything together and realized what I had just done..

Drunk him just word vomits what the whole plan was and who was involved and how long he‚Äôs been working on this (3 months) and how stressed he‚Äôs been and that every time he thinks about it he wants to shit his pants LOL

It was a hilarious moment. We cried, we laughed, we got engaged.

I‚Äôm gonna spend the rest of my life with this man. #screw #einstein #lovemylife #icanexplain", category: relationship_category, created_at: DateTime.now - (rand * 8))
